# **Backend Project | WEB APPLICATION**
This is a **backend-driven web application** built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**. The project showcases my ability to develop a **full-fledged backend system**, including **routing, database management, authentication, and templating**. It follows the **MVC architecture**, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

### **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
In this project, I developed a **dynamic web application** using **Node.js and Express.js** for the backend, **MongoDB** for the database, and **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** for rendering dynamic views. The focus was on building a **scalable, secure, and well-structured backend** to handle different functionalities such as **user authentication, data management, and API handling**.

### **ðŸš€ Key Features:**  
âœ… **RESTful API** â€“ Built efficient and scalable APIs using **Express.js** for handling various requests.  
âœ… **Templating with EJS** â€“ Used **EJS** to render dynamic content, making the frontend interactive without heavy client-side frameworks.  
âœ… **MongoDB Database** â€“ Integrated **MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)** for structured data management and CRUD operations.  
âœ… **Authentication & Authorization** â€“ Implemented **JWT-based authentication** for secure access control.  
âœ… **Routing System** â€“ Followed a **modular routing structure** for better maintainability and scalability.  
âœ… **Session Management** â€“ Used **Express-session** to handle user sessions effectively.  
âœ… **Form Handling & Validation** â€“ Processed user inputs securely with built-in validation mechanisms.  
âœ… **3rd Party Modules** â€“ Integrated **bcrypt.js, JSON Web Token (JWT), Express-session, and SweetAlert** for enhanced security and user interaction.  
âœ… **Error Handling & Middleware** â€“ Implemented **custom error-handling middleware** to ensure smooth application flow.

### **ðŸ›  Technologies Used:**  
- **Node.js** â€“ Server-side runtime for handling requests efficiently.  
- **Express.js** â€“ Lightweight and fast framework for building backend APIs.  
- **MongoDB (Mongoose)** â€“ NoSQL database for storing and retrieving application data.  
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** â€“ For rendering **dynamic web pages** using server-side templating.  
- **bcrypt.js** â€“ For hashing passwords securely.  
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** â€“ For secure authentication and authorization.  
- **Express-session** â€“ For managing user sessions.  
- **SweetAlert** â€“ For displaying elegant and user-friendly alerts.
