### **Backend Project | WEB APPLICATION**  
This is a **backend-driven web application** built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**. The project showcases my ability to develop a **full-fledged backend system**, including **routing, database management, authentication, and templating**. It follows the **MVC architecture**, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

### **📌 Project Overview**  
In this project, I developed a **dynamic web application** using **Node.js and Express.js** for the backend, **MongoDB** for the database, and **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** for rendering dynamic views. The focus was on building a **scalable, secure, and well-structured backend** to handle different functionalities such as **user authentication, data management, and API handling**.

### **🚀 Key Features:**  
✅ **RESTful API** – Built efficient and scalable APIs using **Express.js** for handling various requests.  
✅ **Templating with EJS** – Used **EJS** to render dynamic content, making the frontend interactive without heavy client-side frameworks.  
✅ **MongoDB Database** – Integrated **MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)** for structured data management and CRUD operations.  
✅ **Authentication & Authorization** – Implemented **JWT-based authentication** for secure access control.  
✅ **Routing System** – Followed a **modular routing structure** for better maintainability and scalability.  
✅ **Session Management** – Used **Express-session** to handle user sessions effectively.  
✅ **Form Handling & Validation** – Processed user inputs securely with built-in validation mechanisms.  
✅ **3rd Party Modules** – Integrated **bcrypt.js, JSON Web Token (JWT), Express-session, and SweetAlert** for enhanced security and user interaction.  
✅ **Error Handling & Middleware** – Implemented **custom error-handling middleware** to ensure smooth application flow.
